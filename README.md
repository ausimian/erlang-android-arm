# erlang-android-arm

A dockerfile for building an erlang 23.0 distribution suitable for running on 64-bit android.

The dockerfile also builds a version of OpenSSL suitable for Android, enabling the crypto and ssl applications.

## Build

    docker build -t <tag> .

    docker run --mount type=bind,source=<my/src/dir>,target=/otp <tag>
  
## Deploy

These commands will build erlang for android arm 64-bit and place the distribution in <my/src/dir>. From here, you can use `adb` to push it to your device. Note that historically, `adb` has had issues with symlinks so the `epmd` symlink is removed and recreated on the device.

    cd <my/src/dir>
    rm erlang/bin/epmd
    adb push erlang /data/local/tmp
    adb shell ln -s /data/local/tmp/erlang/erts-11.0/bin/epmd /data/local/tmp/erlang/bin/epmd
  
## Run

    adb shell
    cd /data/local/tmp/erlang
    sh bin/erl
  
## Example


    Z5031O:/data/local/tmp/erlang $ 
    Z5031O:/data/local/tmp/erlang $ sh bin/erl

## Caveats

The 64-bit branch is completely untested due to the author not having an available device.
